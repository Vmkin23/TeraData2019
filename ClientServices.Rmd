Client Services: 
Context: All of our contact records have Created Dates signifying when they first entered into the Hire Heroes USA system, but all clients have a Client Type and Client Category. These individuals are also identified with the Client field. Client Types of Online Registrant, Onward to Opportunity, and AVR are considered part of our PaCT program. Nearly all of these clients registered through one of our registration portals. AVRs (Attempted Veteran Registrants) were not selected for assignment and were sent messaging encouraging them to register again. If selected, they then become Online Registrants. Thus, Client Type just denotes a current status. Current (and former) AVRs are identified by the AVR field.

Q: Is there any relationship between the amount of time spent working with individual clients 
(time to complete an assessment, time to complete resume, # of logged activities, etc.) and how quickly they are employed?

# The time spent with clients the faster they seem to find employment. For instance, the average client that finds employment is within 233 days, but if they were to file an essentials about them their average time employment within 153 days, if they were to participate in a mock interview they on average will find employment within 156 days, and if they were to have a federal resume reviewed they would on average find employment within 171 days. If a candidate were to do all three activities they would be hired within average of 160 days which is 73 days earlier than candidates that did not participate in any of the three activities. So, candidates that participated in more activities with HHUSA would have better chances than candidates that did not participate.

Q: Is there a relationship between a client's demographic profile (rank, branch, time in service, spouse status etc.) and 
when that client registers for services?

# Looking at the graphs we see that the air force typically will register earlier for services than the army. We will also see that veteran officers file earlier than veterans that are enlisted. None labeled as spouses participated in the four offerings and were labeled successfully employed. And geographically clients in AK,AZ,CO,CT,GA,HI,ID,IL,KS,KY,LA,MA,MS,NC,NM,NV,NY,SC,TN,UT,WY filed earlier than clients in AR,CA,IA,MO,OH,OR.

Q: Is there a relationship between a client's demographic profile (rank, branch, time in service, spouse status etc.) and
a client's likelihood to complete a survey?

## Why do I keep trying to make pie charts a thing? They don't show the information off as well as bar graphs


# Looking at our potential survey clients versus our successful clients we see several trends. For instance, we primarily hear back from enlisted and then officers, the branches we are hearing the most back from are the army, air force and navy. Our respondents are primarily male. This is just me describing a demographic and not answering the question I am frustrated and gonna call it for the day.

Q: Is there a way to tell what communication method (call, texting or email) is more successful with clients, either based 
on their success in job placement or some other outcome? What about with regards to completed Volunteer Requests?
